# Kubernetes Networking

```sh
    # Start Minikube - our development cluster
    minikube start

    cd kubernetes

    kubectl apply -f users-service.yaml,users-deployment.yaml,auth-service.yaml,auth-deployment.yaml

## Note about environment Variables

When we create a service Kubernetes autocreate environment variables for these services.
A service named: "auth-service" have a autogenerated "AUTH_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST" environment variable name.
